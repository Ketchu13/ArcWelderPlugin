This is a safety feature to prevent unusually large arcs from being generated.  Internally Arc Welder uses a constant to prevent  arcs with a very large radius from being generated where the path is essentially (but not exactly) a straight line.  If it is not perfectly straight, and if my constant isn't conservative enough, an extremely large arc could be created that may have the wrong direction of rotation.  The default value works fine for all of the gcode I've tested (it is about 1/7th of the radius of the worst errant arc I've encountered).  If you discover that you need to adjust this setting because of errant arcs, please [create an issue](https://github.com/FormerLurker/ArcWelderPlugin/issues/new) and let me know!  The default setting is **1000000 mm** or **1KM**.
