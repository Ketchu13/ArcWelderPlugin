There are three options here:
* *Automatic Processing Only* - Newly uploaded files will be compressed automatically.
* *Manual Processing Only* - Convert files by clicking on the compress button in the file manager.  Files that are already compressed will have the compress button disabled.
* *Automatic and Manual Processing* - Newly uploaded files will automatically be converted **and** you will be able to compress files by clicking the compress button in the file manager.

The default setting is *Automatic and Manual Processing*.
